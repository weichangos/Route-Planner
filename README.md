# Route-Planner
**How it works:**

Step 1: Generate graph for the input 

Step 2: Find all nodes that have an odd number of edges attached 

Step 3: Find all possible sets of pairings of these nodes and their minimum distances, and sum up these distances for each set 

Step 4: Find the set with the least total distance 

Step 5: Integrate the set back into the original graph and find the result
